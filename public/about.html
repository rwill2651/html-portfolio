<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ricky Willoughby. I am an aspiring software developer from Newport News, VA</p>

<p>Since childhood, I have always been an early adopter of tech (my list of devices would be
  staggering if I wrote them all down). My fascination with tech has also extended to my
  imagination in the form of science fiction and dystopias.
</p>

<p>My goal with this website is to show off my expertise in various coding languages
  both to accurately inform potential employers and to preserve a digital journal of 
  my progress.
